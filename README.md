All code is provided as-is. I will not be providing support for any of these. Feel free to use them in any of your projects.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**armour** - adds armour /w durability. Taking damage removes armour first, once armour reaches 0 you'll take health damage.

**durability** - adds weapon durability.

**legacy_farm** - adds a functioning basic mushroom farm entity with poopy model  

**industry** - An improved legacy_farm and more. Adds a farm entity /w multiple crops supported, a brewery, animals, traps, foraging. AND LOTS OF FEATURE CREEP. This addon was custom made for someone else's schema, it's a huge mess so sorry in advance but I'm outtie 5000. Therefore, the plans to clean it up, and remove the sloppy tacked-on features were scrapped.
